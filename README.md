# Android Studio Project for SQLite Database + OpenStreetMap API
# By Malindu Liyanage

This App basically shows the map as a view and if the user made a single tap on the map, it shows the tapped location coordinates as a toast message.
If the user has long pressed on a certain location, then it will be recorded in the Database itself. 
By clicking on See Locations, saved locations on the DB can be viewed.

based on OpenStreetMap API.
